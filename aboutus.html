      <p>With venues in both Mayfair and Knightsbridge, T's Kitchen creates an environment for guests to enjoy a truly authentic Arabic drinking, dining and shisha experience in the heart of London.

          Our Indian menus feature the very best of traditional Indian and Bengali cuisines as well as a selection of European fusion dishes created by our experienced head chefs. This is paired with an eclectic selection of cocktails served at our bars by expert mixologists and a halal Indian Afternoon Tea at our Knightsbridge venue. 
                    
          Our restaurants are perfect for relaxed day-time dining and offer a slightly different experience in the evenings. At night, both venues come alive with beautiful belly-dancers and traditional Indian musicians, evoking the energetic buzz of Mumbai for an unforgettable experience every time.</p>
